## Project Summary

  The goal of this project is to implement all the steps needed to model processes and applications. The first step is to describe the levels of menangement and the business environment of the company through genetic defintion, p/c matrix, list of classes etc.
Next step involves modeling entities and relationships with ER tool.The final action includes the implementation of the application through the APEX system.
